This booklet describes RedditSt20, a fork and extension of "Reddit.st in 10
elegant classes" by another 10 or so classes.

!! Reddit.st in 10 elegant classes

Reddit.st, written by Sven Van Caekenberghe, demonstrates a small but
non-trivial web application written in *Pharo>http://www.pharo.org/* using
*Seaside>http://seaside.st*, *Glorp>http://glorp.org*, and
*PostgreSQL>http://www.postgresql.org/*. It is described in its own
*booklet>https://ci.inria.fr/pharo-contribution/view/Books/job/Booklet-Reddit/*.


!! RedditSt20

RedditSt20 extends Reddit.st to include the following:

- GlorpSQLite
- Seaside-MDL
- username/password authentication
- logging
- 2-factor authentication

!! Source Code

To follow along transforming Reddit.st into RedditSt20 in the same way that
the author did in writing this booklet, download a 
*pre-built image of Reddit.st>https://ci.inria.fr/pharo-contribution/job/Reddit/*
and go through the chapters in order. In the rest of this booklet, we refer to 
this image as Reddit.image. 

As each transformation took place, the code for RedditSt20 was committed to
its *Smalltalkhub repository>http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~PierceNg/RedditSt20*. 
E.g., Reddit-PierceNg.14 corresponds to Reddit.st with the GlorpSQLite
transformation. The appendix lists the major versions of the code in the
repository.

!! GlorpSQLite
@GlorpSQLite

*SQLite>http://sqlite.org* is highly reliable, full-featured,
self-contained, embeddable, and the most used SQL database engine in the
world. Glorp, Generic Light-weight Object-Relational Persistence, is an
open source relational mapping layer that for Smalltalk including Pharo.
GlorpSQLite is an integration of Glorp with SQLite for Pharo, written by
the author.  RedditSt20 uses GlorpSQLite, instead of Glorp with PostgreSQL,
as a demonstration of the pluggability of Glorp.

!!! Installing SQLite

SQLite is bundled with MacOS and most distributions of Linux. For use with
Pharo, the SQLite shared library must be installed such as Pharo can locate
it. The command line executable 'sqlite3' is also handy to have available.


!!! Installing GlorpSQLite

You may install GlorpSQLite from the Catalog Browser in Pharo 6 and above,
or use the following snippet:

[[[
Gofer it
  smalltalkhubUser: 'DBXTalk' project: 'Glorp';
  package: 'ConfigurationOfGlorpSQLite';
  load.
(#ConfigurationOfGlorpSQLite asClass project version: #stable) load.
]]]

After installation, start Test Runner and run the Glorp test
suite. Provided Pharo can locate the SQLite shared library, Test Runner
should report that 889 tests have passed, with another 12 tests
skipped. The test run produces the file sodbxtestu.db in the directory
containing Reddit.image. You may open sodbxtestu.db with the 'sqlite3'
command-line shell to inspect its structure and content.

!!! Transforming Reddit.st

The class RedditDatabaseResource connects Reddit.st to PostgreSQL. In
RedditSt20, we subclass RedditDatabaseResource to use SQLite:

[[[
RedditDatabaseResource subclass: #RedditSQLiteResource
  instanceVariableNames: ''
  classVariableNames: ''
  package: 'Reddit'
]]]

RedditSQLiteResource has one class-side method:

[[[
createLogin
  "When you make changes here, you will most probably want to reset the cached login"

  "self resetLogin"

  ^ Login new 
      database: UDBCSQLite3Platform new;
      host: SmalltalkImage current imagePath asFileReference parent fullName,
              FileSystem disk delimiter asString;
      port: '';
      username: '';
      password: '';
      databaseName: 'reddit.db';
      yourself	
]]]

This method creates RedditSt20's database in the file reddit.db in the 
directory containing Reddit.image.

One more change to Reddit.st is required to switch from PostgreSQL to
SQLite, in the method #newGlorpSession of RedditSession:

[[[
newGlorpSession
  | session |
  session := RedditSQLiteResource session.
  session accessor logging: true.
  ^ session
]]]

To complete the switch, in a playground in Reddit.image, evaluate the following
snippet to create the database file reddit.db with the necessary structure:

[[[
RedditSQLiteResource 
  resetLogin;
  createLogin;
  createTables
]]]

Use the 'sqlite3' shell to inspect reddit.db:

[[[language=bash
% sqlite3 reddit.db
SQLite version 3.13.0 2016-05-18 10:57:30
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> .schema
CREATE TABLE REDDIT_LINKS (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT  NOT NULL ,url text  NULL ,title text  NULL ,created timestamp  NULL ,points integer  NULL );
sqlite> 
]]]
